# Bootstrap_Responsive_Portfolio
A responsive portfolio about me
---

My goal was to create a responsive, personal portfolio web page: a page that is visually pleasing on various screen sizes.

As screen sizes differ across devices, I needed a layout that would remain easily readable wether your on a desktop or your mobile phone.

## Each page has a
- functioning, responsive navigation bar and navigation links
- responsive div containers
- a sticky footer

## index.html
- the image shrinks and text wraps the image and shrinks as the screen size does.

## contact.html
- the form shrinks and grows as screen size does

## portfolio.html
- responsive cards
